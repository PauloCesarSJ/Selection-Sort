Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by dividing the array into two parts - the sorted part and the unsorted part. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the desired order) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.
